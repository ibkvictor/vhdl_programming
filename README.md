# TEST BENCH
A generalized test bench suite for bit signals in VHDL requiring only alternating the number of input signals to reflect the boolean algebra.
** NOTE ** However, this testbench suit does not assert for output signals and cannot be used for verification.

## LEARNT
`std_logic` in vhdl
`for` loop in vhdl
`to_unsigned` in vhdl to convert from integer to std_logic
