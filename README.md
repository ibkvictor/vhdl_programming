# TEST BENCH
A generalized test bench suite for bit signals in VHDL requiring only alternating the number of input signals to reflect the boolean algebra.
<br/>
** NOTE ** However, this test-bench suit does not assert for output signals and cannot be used for verification.

## LEARNT
- `std_logic` in VHDL
- `for` loop in VHDL
- `to_unsigned` in VHDL to convert from integer to std_logic
